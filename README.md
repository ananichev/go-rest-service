# go-rest-service
An basic REST service (todo app) written in GO.

## About the project
I'm working on this project to get to know more about REST services in GO. Specifically, my final goal is to have an fully functional REST service running on Google AppEngine (GAE).

## Milestones
1. ~~Create an basic MVP saving and retrieving data on MySQL;~~
2. ~~Do whatever is needed to get it up and running on GAE.~~
3. ~~Move the database from MySQL to a noSQL (Google Datastore?)~~
4. Add authentication (?)
5. Add an new Entity `Task` that will be assigned to a given `User`

## Plus
~~As I don't have a tight deadline, I will try to develop this using vim.~~
_Nevermind! I'm using JetBrains GoGland and I'm pretty happy with it._
